      "title": "Redesign portfolio with minimalist monospace two-tone aesthetic",
      "description": "Complete visual redesign of the portfolio site (me project) to achieve a minimalist, developer-focused aesthetic with the following specifications:\n\n**Core Design Principles:**\n1. **Monospace Typography**: Use monospace fonts throughout (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or similar) to appeal to developers\n2. **Two-Tone Color Palette**: Strictly two colors - a dark tone (not pure black, e.g., #1a1a1a or #0f0f0f) and a light tone (not pure white, e.g., #f5f5f5 or #fafafa)\n3. **Minimalist Layout**: Clean, uncluttered design with ample whitespace and clear visual hierarchy\n4. **No Animations**: Remove all non-essential animations. If any animations exist, they must be extremely subtle and purposeful (e.g., simple fade-in on page load)\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Update Tailwind config to use the new two-tone color palette\n- Configure typography to use monospace fonts globally\n- Remove or simplify all existing Three.js/3D elements unless absolutely necessary\n- Remove framer-motion animations or replace with CSS transitions if absolutely needed\n- Ensure all existing functionality remains intact (CV editing, API routes, etc.)\n- Maintain responsive design principles\n- Keep PostHog analytics working\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Updated tailwind.config.ts with new color scheme and font settings\n- Modified app/globals.css for new typography and color foundation\n- Updated app/layout.tsx with monospace font configuration\n- Redesigned app/page.tsx with minimalist two-tone aesthetic\n- Any other components in src/ folder updated to match new design\n- All existing features (CV editor, API endpoints) still functional\n\n**Design Examples to Emulate:**\n- Think: terminal/IDE aesthetic but modern and polished\n- Inspiration: stripe.dev docs, GitHub's dark mode, Vercel's minimalist branding\n- Emphasis on content over decoration, clarity over cleverness",
