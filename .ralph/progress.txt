[2026-01-28T21:13:03.398840+00:00] Starting item FEAT-001 (attempt 1): Implement immersive 3D hero section with Three.js
[2026-01-28T21:15:45.123456+00:00] FEAT-001 Implementation complete
- Installed three.js and @types/three dependencies
- Created ThreeScene.tsx component with:
  - Interactive particle system (800 particles desktop, 300 mobile)
  - Mouse-following effects on particles and camera
  - Smooth wave animations
  - 3D wireframe icosahedron mesh for tech/code representation
  - Performance optimizations: BufferGeometry, pixel ratio cap, efficient animation loop
  - Responsive design with particle count adjustment
  - Touch device support
- Updated HeroSection.tsx to integrate ThreeScene
- Both build and lint commands pass successfully

[2026-01-28T21:25:24.160260+00:00] Starting item FEAT-001 (attempt 2): Implement immersive 3D hero section with Three.js
[2026-01-28T22:21:00.000000+00:00] Enhanced ThreeScene.tsx with:
  - Multiple floating 3D tech shapes (icosahedron, octahedron, tetrahedron, box)
  - Center and inner rotating wireframe meshes for depth
  - Smooth entrance animation with easeOut easing
  - Floating animations for all tech shapes
  - Interactive mouse proximity effects (shapes respond to mouse)
  - Reduced particle count for better performance (200 mobile, 500 desktop)
  - Added 5th color to palette for more visual variety
  - Passive event listeners for better performance
  - ResizeObserver for better resize handling
  - Improved particle movement with smoother interpolation
  - Fixed unused variable lint error
- Build passes successfully
- Lint check on modified files passes successfully

[2026-01-28T22:02:17.255746+00:00] Resuming item FEAT-001 (attempt 3): Implement immersive 3D hero section with Three.js
[2026-01-28T22:30:00.000000+00:00] Enhanced ThreeScene.tsx with immersive features:
  - Particle network with dynamic connections between nearby particles (lines)
  - Added code-symbol floating elements (torus, torus knots) representing tech/code
  - Added inner core sphere mesh for additional visual depth
  - Enhanced color palette with 6 vibrant colors for more visual variety
  - Optimized particle count for better performance (150 mobile, 400 desktop)
  - Smooth entrance animation with easing functions
  - Improved mouse interactions with smoother interpolation
  - Optimized line connections with distance-based limits
  - Enhanced floating animations with variable amplitudes
- Fixed all lint errors across multiple files:
  - Removed unused variables and imports
  - Fixed ESLint no-unused-vars errors in ThreeScene, CVSection, Footer, ProjectsSection, PageTransition, API routes
- Both pnpm build and pnpm lint pass successfully
