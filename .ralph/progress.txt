[2026-01-29T05:20:00.000000+00:00] Implemented FEAT-008: Add interactive dark/light mode with smooth transitions

Created ThemeToggle.tsx component with:
  - Smooth animated sun/moon icon transitions using framer-motion
  - Rotation animations (90 degrees to -90 degrees) when switching themes
  - Scale and opacity animations for smooth icon morphing
  - Hover and tap interactions (scale up to 1.1, scale down to 0.95)
  - Color-coded icons: yellow-300 for sun, indigo-300 for moon
  - Proper accessibility labels that update dynamically
  - Prevents hydration mismatch with mounted state

Updated app/globals.css:
  - Added smooth color transitions for all themeable properties (background-color, color, border-color, box-shadow)
  - 0.3s ease-in-out timing function for seamless theme switching
  - Added theme-aware animations (fadeIn, slideUp)
  - Added .theme-transition utility class
  - Enhanced prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable all transitions when requested
  - Updated body styles with explicit transition classes

Updated tailwind.config.ts:
  - Enhanced accent color palette with full 50-900 scale
  - Added light theme color palette (light-50 to light-900)
  - Accent colors use sky blue (#0ea5e9) base with full gradient
  - Colors are consistent across both light and dark modes
  - All colors follow semantic naming convention

Updated src/components/Navbar.tsx:
  - Replaced inline theme toggle buttons with new ThemeToggle component
  - Both desktop and mobile versions now use the same animated component
  - Removed unused theme state variables and useTheme import
  - Maintained all existing functionality and layout

Updated app/layout.tsx:
  - Enhanced body styling with proper theme classes
  - Uses light-50 for light mode, dark-DEFAULT for dark mode
  - Added explicit transition-colors duration-300 class for smooth theme switching

Key Features:
  - Theme preference persists across sessions (via next-themes localStorage)
  - All components support both themes with consistent transitions
  - Color interpolation is smooth with 300ms duration
  - Accent colors complement the overall design in both themes
  - Respects user accessibility preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
  - No hydration flash due to proper mounted state handling

Verification:
  - pnpm build: SUCCESS
  - pnpm lint: SUCCESS
