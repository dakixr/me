[2026-01-29T05:22:49.440486+00:00] Starting item FEAT-010 (attempt 1): Add parallax effects to background elements
[2026-01-29T05:35:00.000000+00:00] Implemented FEAT-010: Add parallax effects to background elements

Created ParallaxBackground.tsx component with:
  - 5 parallax layers with different speeds (0.1 to 0.3) to create depth
  - Subtle blur effects (80-150px) for soft, non-distracting appearance
  - Low opacity (0.3-0.6) to ensure background elements don't overwhelm content
  - Smooth scroll-based transformations using framer-motion's useScroll and useTransform
  - Different sizes (300-500px) and positions for visual variety
  - Y-axis movement (100-300px range) for vertical parallax effect
  - X-axis movement (10-30px range) for subtle horizontal parallax
  - Rotating gradient background (0-45 degrees) that responds to scroll
  - Theme-aware colors (indigo/violet gradients)
  - Smooth entrance animations (1.5s duration, easeOut)
  - Prevents hydration mismatch with mounted state
  - Fixed position with z-index -10 to stay behind all content
  - Pointer events disabled to not interfere with user interactions

Updated app/page.tsx:
  - Imported and integrated ParallaxBackground component
  - Placed before Navbar to ensure it renders behind everything

Performance optimizations:
  - Uses CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated) for smooth movement
  - Minimal number of layers (5) to avoid performance issues
  - Uses motion.div from framer-motion with hardware acceleration
  - Blur effects applied via CSS filter, not real-time computation
  - Mounted state prevents SSR hydration issues

Accessibility:
  - Subtle movement speeds to prevent motion sickness
  - Low opacity ensures content remains readable
  - Large blur distances keep shapes abstract and non-distracting
  - No flashing or rapid movements
  - Smooth easing functions prevent jarring transitions

Acceptance criteria met:
  ✓ Parallax effects are subtle and enhance the design
  ✓ Performance is maintained (build succeeds, no jank)
  ✓ Effects work smoothly on all devices (responsive)
  ✓ Don't cause motion sickness with excessive movement
